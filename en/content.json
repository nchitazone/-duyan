Once num was removed , the variable return to the state has not been declared , so if we use this variable without declaring it, NameError errors will occur as follows: Copynum = 10print(num)# 10del numprint(num) The NameError returns: CopyTraceback (most recent call last): File &quot;Main.py&quot;, line 7, in &lt;module&gt; print(num)NameError: name &#x27;num&#x27; is not defined When writing your program, if for some reason you want to delete variable from python, remember to use the del command .And note that you must only be able to delete a variable that was declared previously, otherwise a NameError will occur: Copydel numprint(num)&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):&gt; File &quot;Main.py&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;&gt; del num&gt;NameError: name &#x27;num&#x27; is not defined SummaryAbove, Kiyoshi explained how to delete variable from python with the del command in python already.

The variable assignments in python can be done at the same time or after you declare variables in python. You can assign a different value to a defined variable, or you can assign a variable to another. Let’s learn how to assign variables in python after this lesson. Assign variables in pythonAssign another value to a specified variableWhen declaring variables in python, we need to specify a value to assign to that variable.However, after declaring that variable, we can also assign another value to that variable like the following example: Copyprice = 100price = 200print(price)#&gt;&gt; 200 In python variable post you know what the variable in python is not the address of the location containing the value in memory, but just the tag to address that data only. So when we assign a different value to a specified variable, we simply change the address line on the variable.Therefore, the variable nature does not change, only the address of the value in memory to which it is assigned has changed. Again, the values ​​used to assign to variables can be of different data types, but variables in python are automatically recognized the data type when assigned a value.Therefore, you can assign a variable of a different data type to the same variable as shown in the following example: Copyname = &quot;Kiyoshi&quot;name = 30print(name)#&gt;&gt; 30 In the above example, although the variable name is declared with the value as a string, it can then still be assigned by the value as a number. That’s thanks to in python, variables are automatically recognized the type of value assigned to it Assign one variable to anotherWe can assign a variable already declared to another, like in the following example: Copynum1 = 100num2 = num1print(&quot;num1&quot;,num1)#&gt;&gt; num1 100print(&quot;num2&quot;,num2)#&gt;&gt; num2 100 In this case, both the variable num1and num2both write to and point to the same address, which is the location of the value 100in memory. Note, however, that if we now assign a new value to the variable num1, the value of the variable num2will remain unchanged. Copynum1 = 100num2 = num1num1 = 200print(&quot;num1&quot;,num1)#&gt;&gt; 200print(&quot;num2&quot;,num2)#&gt;&gt; 100 If you assign a different value num1 instead of storing the new value in the location that it num1 is referencing, num1the address of that new value will be written in memory.At this point, the variable is num2 still referring to the original position, so the variable num1 refers to the valued position 200 and the variable num2refers to the valued position 100.So when printing to the screen, the values ​​of these two variables will be different: Copynum1 200num2 100 SummaryAbove, Kiyoshi showed you how to assign variables in python.

Python will automatically determine the data type of the variable being declared.We just need to declare the variable in python by assigning the variable in python with the following syntax: Syntax of Declare variables in python variable = value Trong đó variable is set according to the Python Variable Naming Rule that you learned in the article What is Variable in Python . The mark = used to assign variables in python . The value in the right of the mark = will be assigned to the variable on the left. value used to declare variables can be strings, numbers, or other types of objects in python. Example of variable declaration in pythonFor example: Copyold = 24 # Variable value is numberstr = &quot;Hello&quot; # Variable value is stringcolorlist = [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;yerllow&quot;] # Variable value is list Using variables in pythonAfter declaring the variable in python, you can use it by writing the variable name in the program. When using a variable in python, the value assigned to that variable will be used instead of the variable when processed in python. Copynum = 30print(num)#&gt;&gt; 10 Like in the above example, after declaring a variable by assigning a value 30 to a variable num, when using a variable num in the function print, the assigned value 30 will be used instead of the variable when printed on the screen. Declaring variable types in pythonWhen you declare a variable in python, Python will automatically determine the data type of the variable to be declared. So you do not need to worry about whether the data type you have declared in the variable is correct or not. If you want to test the data type after declaring a variable in python, use the function typle() in python like the following example: Copymyvar = 1234print(type(myvar))# &lt;class &#x27;int&#x27;&gt;mystr = &quot;hello&quot;print(type(mystr))# &lt;class &#x27;str&#x27;&gt; SummaryAbove, Kiyoshi showed you how to declare a variable in python.

You will know what variable is in python , how to name a variable in python as well as how to use python variables after this lesson. What are variables in pythonThere are two schools of variable definition in python as follows: The first school considered the variable in python as a box for storing data. These data can be numbers or strings that you can store in the variable and use over and over again. The results of operations such as calculating numeric values, editing text strings will be temporarily stored in variables and used for later use in the program. The second school considers the variable in python to be the same as the tag of the address of the data. The data is stored in separate locations in memory with different addresses, and the variable in python is the tag used to write the address of that data in memory. When using data, we access the address written on the variable of that data. Trường phái thứ hai coi biến trong python giống như thẻ ghi địa chỉ của dữ liệu. Các dữ liệu được lưu giữ tại các vị trí riêng biệt trong bộ nhớ với địa chỉ khác nhau, và biến trong python là thẻ dùng để ghi địa chỉ của dữ liệu đó trong bộ nhớ. Khi sử dụng dữ liệu, chúng ta sẽ truy cập vào địa chỉ được ghi trên biến của dữ liệu đó. You also do not need to pay too much attention to which school is right, just remember the concept of variables in python in one of the two ways above. Name variable in pythonTo name variables in python we need to follow Python’s Variable Naming Rule as below: The characters can be used to name variables in python is a ~ z, A ~ Z, 0 ~ 9, underline _, font auto drought, Vietnamese marks etc. Numeric values ​​(0 to 9) cannot be used for the first character. An underscore can be used for the first character. However since the underline is often used in special cases, it is better not to use it. Case sensitive when naming variables in python Python keywords cannot be used. We will learn more about the Rules of variable naming in Python in the table above as follows Use alphabet characters, numbers, and underscores to name variables in PythonFrom Python 3 onwards, we can use kanji and accented Vietnamese to Name variables in python, however Kiyoshi does not recommend this method. Copytên = &quot;Kiyoshi&quot;tuổi =30名前 = &quot;Kiyoshi&quot;年齢 = 30 Do not use numeric values ​​for the first character of a variableWe cannot use numeric values ​​for the first character of the variable in python, because a SyntaxError will appear. Copy7up = 100 Error SyntaxError: Copy File &quot;Main.py&quot;, line 1 7up = 100 ^SyntaxError: invalid syntax Case sensitive when naming variables in PythonCase sensitive when Naming variables in python. The two variables in the example below are different and give different results: Copystr = &quot;I love&quot;STR = &quot;Vietnam&quot;print ( str , STR)&gt;&gt; I love Vietnam Do not use Python keywords to name variables in pythonWe can’t use Python keywords to name variables in python. Keywords are Python-only words and you cannot use them to name variables.You can check the List of keywords in python with the command below. Copyimport sysimport keyword print (&quot;Python version: &quot;, sys.version_info)print (&quot;Python keywords: &quot;, keyword.kwlist) And here is the table of keywords in python . CopyFalse await else import passNone break except in raiseTrue class finally is returnand continue for lambda tryas def from nonlocal whileassert del global not withasync elif if or yield If you use the keywords in python in the table above to name the variable in Python then the error SyntaxError will return the following example: Copyfrom = &quot;Vietnam&quot; Lỗi SyntaxError: Copy File &quot;Main.py&quot;, line 1 from = &quot;Vietnam&quot; ^SyntaxError: invalid syntax How to use python variablesIn the example below, we write a program that calculates the prices (including VAT) of the fruits and prints them on the screen. Copyprint (&quot;Orange price&quot; + str (120 * 1.1))print (&quot;Apple price&quot; + str (90 * 1.1))print (&quot;Banana price&quot; + str (100 * 1.1)) If every time we also declare VAT as above, it can be mistaken for carelessness, or in the case of VAT adjustment by the state, we must completely correct it. That is very easy to mistake and costly. Instead, we’ll use the variable in python by creating a variable tax, then storing the VAT value 1.1in. When using it, we just need to name the variable taxas below: Copytax = 1.1 print ( &quot;Orange price&quot; + str ( 120 * tax)) print ( &quot;Apple price&quot; + str ( 90 * tax)) print ( &quot;Banana price&quot; + str ( 100 * tax)) Both of the above spellings give the same result: CopyOrange price 132.0 Apple price 99.00000000000001 Banana price 110.00000000000001 Assuming the state has raised the VAT rate to 1.5times, then simply change the value of the taxcity 1.5 Copytax = 1.5 print ( &quot;Orange price&quot; + str ( 120 * tax)) print ( &quot;Apple price&quot; + str ( 90 * tax)) print ( &quot;Banana price&quot; + str ( 100 * tax)) From the above example, you can see that using variables in python helps us to minimize errors compared to entering values ​​directly, as well as help to change the value of data in the program quickly and efficiently. than. SummaryAbove, Kiyoshi explained what the concept of a variable is in python, how to name a variable in python as well as how to use a variable in python .

You will learn how to comment in python with pound sign #, how to comment multiple lines in python as well as how to apply comment in python after this lesson. What is comment in pythonComments in python are lines of code that are ignored when running a python program, to help you save necessary information such as the date and time of writing the program, the name of the writer, the writing goal, explain sub-items in python program etc. Necessary information is kept by comment in python making it easier for you to maintain the program, as well as easily transfer the project to others or share the project with many people. Comment in pythonTo write comments in python, we write the following mark # with the following syntax: #comment In which comment is the comment content which placed after the mark #. Comments in python are calculated from behind the trailing mark # to the end of the line. We can comment to the beginning or the middle or anywhere in the statement, just like in the following example: Copy## # initialization: 2021-01-08 # author: Kiyoshi ##age = 30 # creates the age variable#in screenprint (age) Note that we can not comment in python if in that statement the line break and write on multiple lines like below example: Copynum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 \\ # Cannot comment on this location. 5 + 6 print (num) The error SyntaxError will appear as follows: CopyFile &quot;Main.py&quot; , line 1 num = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 \\ # Cannot comment on this location. ^ SyntaxError: unexpected character after line continuation character On how to line break in a statement and write it on multiple lines, you can refer to the article Line break in python. Comment multiple lines in pythonTocomment multiple lines in python, we write comment lines between three single quotes &#39;&#39;&#39; or three quotation marks &quot;&quot;&quot; with the following syntax: &quot;&quot;&quot;Comment line 1Comment line 2…&quot;&quot;&quot; Hoặc &#39;&#39;&#39;Comment line 1Comment line 2…&#39;&#39;&#39; The essence of this writing is that we declare a multi-line string in python and do not add any handling commands to the newly declared string.Therefore, the newly created multi-line chain will only store information without affecting the result of program processing. On how to declare a multi-line string in python , you can refer to the declaration in python in detail We use this quotation mark to comment over multiple lines in python like following example: Copy&quot;&quot;&quot; Date of writing: 210121 Author: Kiyoshi &quot;&quot;&quot;print ( &quot;comment in python&quot; ) You can see how this comment is used a lot in the documentation on Gihub, or in AI programming programs. Note, when using this method, all comment lines must have the same indentation. If there is only one line with a different indent than the rest, an error will occur like the following example: Copyfor i in range ( 3 ): print ( &quot;comment in python&quot; ) &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; An error will occur if commenting here. &quot;&quot;&quot; print (i) Error returned: Copy File &quot;Main.py&quot;, line 8 print(i) ^IndentationError: unexpected indent The reason is that compared to the two lines of print above print(&quot;comment in python&quot;) and below print(i), the indentation of the comment lines is not the same.We need to correct the indentation like this: Copyfor i in range(3): print(&quot;comment in python&quot;) &quot;&quot;&quot; The error did not occur because the lines have the same indent &quot;&quot;&quot; print(i) For loop results will run smoothly as follows: Copycomment in python 0 comment in python 1 comment in python 2 Application of comment in pythonUse comments in python to hold informationWhen writing a python program that is too long, or a project with lots of python programs combined, you should use comments in python to store essential information such as the date and time of the program written, the name of the writer, writing goals, explaining sub-entries in python programs and so on.This is useful when a program crashes and you need to go back somewhere in the program to fix it, and you can’t remember what that line of code means. Then, if you have commentd the meaning of that statement, then remembering and editing the code will be a lot easier. Especially in large projects where many people participate in writing programs, comment will help your teammates understand each part of the program better.Assuming someone is new to the project, you will not take the effort to explain it back to them, read the caption yourself and tinkering :)). Use comments in python to ignore statementsIn addition to using comment in python to hold essential information, you can also use statement ignore comment in python. This approach is called コ メ ン ト ア ウ ト in Japanese. The way to use comment to ignore the statement in python is like the following example: Copyprice = 500price = price * 1.08 print (price) If we run the above program, we will have the result: Copy150.0 If we don’t want to run the second command line anymore, we can delete it. However if we just temporarily do not want to run this command line, comment the second command line and ignore them while processing the program as follows: Copyprice = 500 #price = price * 1.08 print (price) By turning the second line of code into a comment in python, we omitted that command line while processing the program. So only lines 1 and 3 are processed and the result is returned as follows: Copy100 SummaryAbove, Kiyoshi showed you how to comment in python .

You will learn how to line breaks outside of python statements using the line break character in python, how to line break inside a python statement and write it on multiple lines, how to print a line break in python, and how to print No line breaks in python in this lesson.","text":"Instructions on how to break line in python. You will learn how to line breaks outside of python statements using the line break character in python, how to line break inside a python statement and write it on multiple lines, how to print a line break in python, and how to print No line breaks in python in this lesson. Line breaks outside of python statements Basically, a statement in python is written on a single line and is terminated using the newline character generated when you press the ENTER key. This is very different from other languages ​​such as JavaScript, which can arbitrarily break the line created by the ENTER key when writing commands. You can refer to the difference in the article how tobreak line in JavaScript Once the command has finished and you are out of the way, you can optionally break the line by pressing the ENTER key while writing your python code for good visibility. These gaps will also be ignored when the program is processed.For example, we can line breaks outside of an arbitrary python statement like so: Copystr1 = &quot;Hello&quot;str2 =&quot;, Việt Nam&quot;print (str1 + str2) The result of the above example is the same as the following: Copystr1 = &quot;Hello&quot;str2 =&quot;, Việt Nam&quot;print (str1 + str2) Result CopyHello, Việt Nam Line break inside python statement You cannot line breaks inside a python statement just by pressing ENTERAs we all saw above, a statement in python is written on a single line and is terminated with a newline generated when you press ENTER.Therefore, in a statement that is too long, if you want a line break in the statement and write the statement on multiple lines so that it is easy to see, you cannot simply break the line just by pressing the key ENTER.Python will treat that statement to end at the press ENTER key and ignore the rest of the statement, causing the command to crash at runtime.For example the following statement: Copynum = 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 + 60 + 70 print (num) Assuming you want a line break after the character 40 +, if you break the line by pressing ENTER, the error will occur as follows: Copynum = 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 +50 + 60 + 70 print (num) Error SyntaxError was returned: Copy File &quot;Main.py&quot;, line 1 num = 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + ^SyntaxError: invalid syntax So you cannot simply press ENTER to break the line between statements in python. Use the backslash\\ to return a line within the python statementTo return a line within a python statement and write the statement on multiple lines, prepend the backslash \\ where you want the line break in the statement. The written syntax will look like this: abc \\xyz In it abc and xyz are the parts of the statement that you want to write in the middle of the line.A \\ carriage return sign tells python that you want a line break within the python statement and write the statement on multiple lines , so python will not end the statement at this position but continue to read the concatenation at the next line below. With the above error example, we need to rewrite it with the \\ following sign : Copynum = 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + \\50 + 60 + 70print (num) Try this with interactive mode : Pay attention to the yen character, which is the sign \\ represented in windows. And please pay attention to the ellipses ..., it is because python \\ has identified the statement is still continuing after processing , so you can write the above statement. From the example above, you can see that using the diacritic \\has helped us to line up in the middle of a statement that is too long to continue writing and still works. Print line breaks in pythonIn python, we use a function print to print characters to the screen.There are many ways to use the print function , in which the basic syntax of the print function does not specify an option as follows: print(line) line is the output line you want to print to the screen. You can either directly specify the value of the line or assign it to a variable and print the value of that variable. By default, after finishing a statement using the basic print function , the output displayed on the screen will automatically print a line break in pythonSo you don’t need to worry about the resulting line being printed down the line in python. when using the basic print function or not. Let’s see the following specific example: Copy# chỉ định trực tiếp dòng kết quả muốn in ra màn hìnhprint(&quot;Hello&quot;)print(&quot;Viet Nam&quot;)print(&quot;Hello Viet Nam&quot;)# gán biến và in ra màn hìnhxinchao = &quot;Hello&quot;tennuoc= &quot;Viet Nam&quot;print(xinchao)print(tennuoc)print(xinchao + tennuoc) Try both of the above examples in python interactive mode , you can see they both give the same result, as well as the results automatically print newline in python : Copy&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello&quot;)Hello&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Viet Nam&quot;)Viet Nam&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello Viet Nam&quot;)Hello Viet Nam&gt;&gt;&gt; xinchao = &quot;Hello&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt; tennuoc= &quot;Viet Nam&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt; print(xinchao)Hello&gt;&gt;&gt; print(tennuoc)Viet Nam&gt;&gt;&gt; print(xinchao + tennuoc)Hello Viet Nam Print no line break in pythonIn the above section we know. By default, after finishing a statement using the basic print function without option, the results displayed on the screen will automatically print down the line in python .The question is what should we do to print without newline in python ?The way to do it is very simple, we need to add an option by specifying parameters end in the print function as follows: print(line, end=&#39;&#39;) By adding a parameter end=&#39;&#39; to the print function as above, the results will be printed without a line break in python like the following example: Copy# Print no line break in pythonprint(&quot;Welcom to &quot;, end=&#x27;&#x27;)print(&quot;Việt Nam&quot;) Results of printing without line breaks in python: CopyWelcom to Việt Nam SummaryAbove, Kiyoshi showed you how to line break in python.

Copyprint ( &quot;Hello&quot; ) When we try to run the program written in this python file, the following result shows that python has successfully processed the program: For how to write, store, and run programs in python files, please review How to write python programs, store and run python programs . As you can see, since we have written the program in the file with the UTF-8 charset, python with the default that the file to be processed is written in UTF-8 has no problems decoding. characters. And the program has been handled successfully. Character encoding in case the python file is written with character code other than UTF-8If the characters in the python program file are written in a character code other than UTF-8, which common for computers with non-English languages such as Japanese, Korean, Chinese , so that python can decode these character codes when running the program, we need to put the character code in the python file. The syntax for placing the character code used in the python program archive file is as follows: # coding : encodingOr# coding = encoding For example: # coding: shift_jis Again, in a Linux environment, if on the first line of the python program archive files it says #! / Usr / bin / env python3 , use the second character encoding above. Let’s take a look at an example where the python file using Japanese is written with the following Shift_JIS character code: Copyprint (&quot;こんにちは&quot;) ※こ ん に ち は means hello in Japanese When we try to run this python file, since we do not put the Shift_JIS character code used in writing the file, python cannot decode it, and the error occurs: CopySyntaxError: Non-UTF-8 code starting with &#x27;\\x82&#x27; in file sample5-2.py on line 1, but no encoding declared; see http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ for details To solve this error, we proceed to set the character code used in this python program archive file Shift_JIS by adding the first line in this python file with the following line of code: # coding: shift_jis The above python file will have the following content. Copy# coding: shift_jisprint (&quot;こんにちは&quot;) After saving the file above, let us try to run the program. As a result, the program runs smoothly as follows: As above, when writing and saving a python program into a file, if for no special reason we will use the UTF-8 character code.If for any special reason you want to use character code other than UTF-8 to write and save the python file, you need to put the character code used in that file. Common types of character codes are used when placing character codes for use in python filesCommon types of character codes to use when placing character codes for use in python files are as follows: Codec (Character code name) Another way to call ascii 646, us-ascii cp932 932, ms932, mskanji, ms-kanji euc_jp eucjp, ujis, u-jis iso2022_jp csiso2022jp, iso2022jp, iso-2022-jp shift_jis csshiftjis, shiftjis, sjis, s_jis utf_8 U8, UTF, utf8 SummaryAbove, Kiyoshi showed you how to place the character code used in the python program archive file.

And let’s learn more about Python in the next lessons.","categories":[{"name":"PYTHON","slug":"PYTHON","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/categories/PYTHON/"},{"name":"Nhập môn lập trình python","slug":"PYTHON/Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/categories/PYTHON/Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/"},{"name":"Kiến thức căn bản về chương trình python","slug":"PYTHON/Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/Kien-thuc-can-ban-ve-chuong-trinh-python","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/categories/PYTHON/Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/Kien-thuc-can-ban-ve-chuong-trinh-python/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Nhập môn lập trình python","slug":"Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/tags/Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/"},{"name":"Kiến thức căn bản về chương trình python","slug":"Kien-thuc-can-ban-ve-chuong-trinh-python","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/tags/Kien-thuc-can-ban-ve-chuong-trinh-python/"}]},{"title":"List comprehension in Python","slug":"python/nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/list-trong-python/tao-list-bang-phuong-phap-viet-noi-ham-list-comprehension","date":"2020-12-25T03:29:37.000Z","updated":"2021-04-20T09:27:56.983Z","comments":true,"path":"python/nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/list-trong-python/tao-list-bang-phuong-phap-viet-noi-ham-list-comprehension/","link":"","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/python/nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/list-trong-python/tao-list-bang-phuong-phap-viet-noi-ham-list-comprehension/","excerpt":"Let’s learn about List comprehension in Python as well as how to create List comprehension in this lesson.","text":"Let’s learn about List comprehension in Python as well as how to create List comprehension in this lesson. What are List comprehension in PythonWhen working with lists, there will be times when you will need to manipulate complex structured lists, for which with the usual list creation method, you will need a lot of code to be able to initialize them.But the founders of python with the belief that simple python is better than complex , created list comprehension - a special method that only python has, in order to help you shorten essential lines of code and create a complex list in the blink of an eye.In addition to the ability to shorten the lines of code to write, the processing speed of list comprehension method in Python is also considered to be faster than other methods. Create lists by list comprehension in PythonTo create list comprehension in Python , we use the following syntax: [expression for variable in iterable] Inside: expression : A calculated expression that creates the element of a new list. variable : variable is created to assign values ​​of elements within iterable. Through biến, these values ​​will be used to compute biểu thứcand create a new list element. You can use functions such as a built-in python upper, lower, absetc. Or you can write the function yourself and use it biểu thứcabove. About the processing process as follows: Copy1. Create a loop with the for function . 2. In each iteration, the value of each element in the initial list is assigned to the variable 3. Pass the variable into the expression and compute the expression for a result. 4. Use this result as an element to create a new list . Let’s see some practical examples as follows: Create a list of numbers 1 through 5 Copycomprehension_list = [number for number in range(0,6)]print(comprehension_list)#&gt;&gt;[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Here we have used the range () function to create a list of numbers from 0 to 5, then take each value of the element in this list and assign it to the variable number, finally used numberto create the list comprehension_list.You can see more about how to create a new list using the range function in the article Create list by an iterable in python If we do not have list comprehension , we must write the following code: Copyold_list = list(range(0,6))comprehension_list = []for phantu in old_list: comprehension_list.append(phantu)print(comprehension_list)#&gt;&gt;[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] You see, the same results, but using list comprehension has helped us to reduce the code, reducing the effort. Create a list whose element is the square of numbers from 1 to 5This example is a bit more complicated, we do not simply use the element value of the old list, but we need to square this value, then square it. create a new list. Copycomprehension_list = [number**2 for number in range(0,6)]print(comprehension_list)#&gt;&gt; [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25] And the traditional way of writing would be: Copyold_list = list(range(0,6))comprehension_list = []for phantu in old_list: phantu_moi = phantu**2 comprehension_list.append(phantu_moi)print(comprehension_list)#&gt;&gt; [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25] Given a list of different strings, create a new list with the strings in LOWER format. Copylist_thanhpho = [&#x27;Long An&#x27;, &#x27;Ha Noi&#x27;,&#x27;Nam Dinh&#x27;]list_thanhpho_thuong = [thanhpho.lower() for thanhpho in list_thanhpho]print(list_thanhpho_thuong)#&gt;&gt; You can see that with normal writing, the more complex the expression, the more lines we need to code.But with list comprehension , you only need one line of code to solve the problem. IT’S SO COOL Manually create functions and create lists by List comprehension in PythonIn the above section, we used expressions created by functions available in python such as lower, upper etc … You can also create the function yourself and use it instead of the existing functions, like in the the following example: Given a list of integers. Create a new number list whose elements are powers of the numbers in the old list Copylist_number = list ( range ( 11 ))def tim_luy_thua ( number ): return number ** 2 new_list = [tim_luy_thua (number) for printed number list_those] print (new_list) Result Copy[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100] For the list of animal names, create a new list of four-legged animals. Copylist_animal =[ &#x27;dog&#x27; , &#x27;cat&#x27; , &#x27;snake&#x27; , &#x27;elephant&#x27; , &#x27;fish&#x27; ]def find_four_leg (animal): if animal in [ &#x27;dog&#x27; , &#x27;cat&#x27; , &#x27;elephant&#x27; ]: return animal four_leg = [animal for animal in list_animal if find_four_leg(animal)]print(four_leg) Kết quả Copy[&#x27;dog&#x27;, &#x27;cat&#x27;, &#x27;elephant&#x27;] Here you need to know more new knowledge such as: def used to create a function return is used to return the processing results of the function in Used to check whether an element is in the list or not On how to create new functions yourself in python , Kiyoshi would like to see you in a column for details later. Use list comprehension in Python with IF functionWe can also use the constructive method with the conditional function IF. Now, only when the conditional expression is true will the element be added to the new list. The written syntax will look like this: [expression for variable in iterable if conditional expression] About the processing process as follows: Copy1. Use the for function to get each element in the list and assign it to variable 2. Use an expression to create a new value from the variable 3. Evaluate the conditional expression as TRUE or FALSE 4. If TRUE, use the result. formula as an element to create a new list Let’s see the following specific example: Creates a new list of even numbers from an original list of numbers Copylist_so = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]list_so_chan = [so for so in list_so if so%2 ==0]print(list_so_chan)#&gt;&gt; [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] You can combine list creation using the range function and write the above extremely short example like so: Copylist_so_chan = [so for so in list(range(9)) if so % 2 ==0]print(list_so_chan)#&gt;&gt; [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] Here we use the notation %to get the remainder in a division. Learn more at computations in python. You can see more about how to create a new list using the range function in the article Create list by using an iterable If there is no method of writing the content, you will have to write lengthy code like the communication method below: Copylist_so = list(range(9))list_so_chan = []for so in list_so: if so % 2 == 0: list_so_chan.append(so)print(list_so_chan)#&gt;&gt; [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] Once again, you can see that the list comprehension in Python can reduce your code and reduce your work a lot, right? SummarizeList comprehension in Python is a special way of writing python, so if you are new to this, it can be confusing. But once you get used to it, Kiyoshi makes sure you get addicted to it and no longer want to write in the popular way.With the advantages of processing power as well as the ability to shorten code, you will have a chance to encounter this writing in python projects. So hundred or not by hand, let’s master List comprehension in Python by re-practicing today’s examples.

You will learn what is the concept of iterable in python as well as how to create list from iterable in python in this lesson. What is Iterable in python We often encounter the **iterable** keyword when learning how to use data types with multiple elements such as *array, list, tuple, etc*. The concept of iterable is not really complicated, but it can make many new programmers headache there. Details of the iterable Kiyoshi would like to see you in another article. In the framework of this article, you can understand in the simplest way, iterables are objects with many repeating elements such as list, string, tuple. Since the iterable contains many elements, so we can take these elements and create a list from the iterable in python . Create list from iterable in python using classTo create an iterable word list in Python, we need to use it class. This is the part related to object oriented programming that you need to master when learning about python.Regarding the class , please make an appointment to separate you in a separate future. In this article, you can simply understand class as a built-in blueprint , you use this blueprint to create objects that fully inherit the features of the class blueprint .And we will use this class blueprint to generate a list from the iterable in python with the following syntax: class list([ iterable]) In there, the iterable is an argument of the class list, we can specify it as one list, or string , or tuple etc. Specifically, we write the following: Specifies iterable to be a list and creates list from another list in pythonWe assign the iterable argument as a list and create a new list from this list as shown in the following example: Copyordinary_list = [ &quot;A&quot; , &quot;B&quot; , &quot;C&quot; ] new_list = list (ordinary_list); print (new_list)#&gt;&gt; [&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;] You can see that a newly created list has the same elements as the original list. Note that we copy a list to create a new list, so these two lists are two separate objects. Specifies iterable as a string and generates list from string in python We assign the iterable argument of the class to a string and create a new list from this string as shown in the following example: Copymylist= list(&#x27;cityboy&#x27;)print(mylist)#&gt;&gt; [&#x27;c&#x27;, &#x27;i&#x27;, &#x27;t&#x27;, &#x27;y&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;o&#x27;, &#x27;y&#x27;] You can see that a new list has been created consisting of letter-by-letter elements in the specified string. Specify iterable as a tuple and create list from tuple in pythonWe assign the iterable argument of the class to a tuple and create a new list from this tuple as shown in the following example: Copymylist = list((&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;))print(mylist)#&gt;&gt; [&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;] You can see that the original tuple is copied and created a new list. Specifies iterable as a range and generates list from range in python range is an object created by class range , whose elements are consecutive numbers from start to end number, specified in the class’s argument.The syntax for specifying is rangeas follows: class range (start, stop , step) OR class range(stop) In which, the arguments of rangethe mean: start : start number stop : the number ends step : step We can either specify all the arguments as above, or omit and just use the arguments stopas shown below. And if the argument startis omitted, python will be implied start = 0. More specific instructions on functions range, Kiyoshi would like to see you in another article. For now we will create list from range in python like following example: Copymylist = list (range (10))print (mylist)#&gt;&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]mylist = list (range (2, 10))print (mylist)#&gt;&gt; [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]mylist = list (range (2, 10, 2 ))print (mylist)#&gt;&gt; [2, 4, 6, 8] You can see that a new list of elements is the specified number in the rangecreated object . SummarizeAbove, Kiyoshi showed you how to Create list from iterable in python. To better understand the lesson content, practice rewriting today’s examples.

Let’s learn how to sort elements in python list through this lesson.","text":"Did you know that after creating a list, you can freely sort the elements in the python list in ascending or descending order? Let’s learn how to sort elements in python list through this lesson. To sort elements in a python list , we need to use a function sortedor method sorted. With these two ways, we will directly sort the values ​​of the elements in the list in ascending or descending order.Alternatively, you can also use the value of these elements as an argument to an intermediate function, then get the value obtained to perform the element sort. Sort the elements in the python listSort elements in python list with function sorted()We sorted the element in the python list using sorted() function with the following syntax: newlist = sorted ( ordinary_list , * , key = None, reverse = False ) You can also omit an argument and just use the argument ordinary_list as follows. In fact, this is also the most commonly used spelling when you want to use functions sorted() by default. newlist = sorted ( ordinary_list) In addition, we can also use sorted() function not only with lists, but also with strings, tuples etc. So you can also replace the argument ordinary_list with string or tuple or any other data type that contains an element that you need to arrange. The only thing to notice is, the argument itself specified does not change, list is still list, tuple is still tuple, string is still string. But the result will always be a new list. Please pay attention, do not wonder why put a string of characters to sort that the result returns to list. To make it easier to understand, let’s see the following example, we will use the function sorted() like this: Copylist_old = [ &quot;C&quot; , &quot;A&quot; , &quot;B&quot; ] new_list = sorted (list_old)print ( list_old) # &gt;&gt; [&quot;C&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;]print (new_list) # &gt;&gt; [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;] You can see, list_old has been rearranged in ascending order, right? Sort the elements in the python list using the method sort()If the sort object is a list, in addition to using the function sorted(), you can use the method sort() to reorder one list. The syntax is as simple as below. list.sort() The usage, the sorting results of the method sort() are the same as the function sorted. Take a look at the same example above with the method’s usage sort: Copymylist = [&quot;C&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;]mylist.sort()print(mylist)#&gt;&gt; [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;] As you can see, the results will be the same as when you used the function sorted(). Difference between sorted(list) vs list.sorted in pythonAlthough the results of the two methods are the same, the difference here is: The function sorted() does not change ordinary_list but creates a new_list reordered from ordinary_list The method sort() is not create a new list but only rearranges the original list itself. Also need to note more, inherently fuction and method also different in nature and usage. We will clarify this issue in the following article. In short, you use functions sorted() when you need to create a new object (list). In the event that you don’t need to create a new object, you will use the method sort(). For exampleHere, we will see a few examples of how to sort a list with the elements of list are numbers and characters offline. Copy#Sắp xếp một list có phần tử là sốnumlist = [84, 75, 92, 90, 78]newnumlist = sorted(numlist)print(&quot;Before:&quot;, numlist)#&gt;&gt; Before: [84, 75, 92, 90, 78]print(&quot;After: &quot;, newnumlist)#&gt;&gt; After: [75, 78, 84, 90, 92] Copy#Sorts a list whose elementscolorlist = [&quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;]newcolorlist = sorted(colorlist)print(&quot;Before:&quot;, colorlist)#&gt;&gt; Before: [&#x27;Blue&#x27;, &#x27;Red&#x27;, &#x27;Green&#x27;, &#x27;White&#x27;, &#x27;Black&#x27;]print(&quot;After: &quot;, newcolorlist)#&gt;&gt; After: [&#x27;Black&#x27;, &#x27;Blue&#x27;, &#x27;Green&#x27;, &#x27;Red&#x27;, &#x27;White&#x27;] Sorting elements in the python list contains elements of different data typesIn the above section, we learned how to sort the elements in a python list, if that list consists of only the same elements, such as numbers, or strings. So when the data types of the elements in the list are different, what do we do? The answer here is, if the elements in the list are of different datatypes but are still comparable, then we can sort the list as usual with a function sortedor method sort. For example you want to arrange an integer with float or complex number for example. Like the following example: Copy# Sort list of integers and real numbers. numlist = [ 5 , 3.14 , 4 , 78 , 4 ]newnumlist = sorted (numlist) print (newnumlist) # &gt;&gt; [3.14, 4, 4, 5, 78] But if you want to sort a list of elements of different data types and they cannot be compared, such as strings and numbers, then if you use the function sortedthen the error TypeErrorwill happen as below : Copymylist = [&quot;80&quot;, 75, 45, &quot;68&quot;]newmylist = sorted(mylist) The result returned an error: CopyTraceback (most recent call last): File &quot;Main.py&quot;, line 2, in &lt;module&gt; newmylist = sorted(mylist)TypeError: &#x27;&lt;&#x27; not supported between instances of &#x27;int&#x27; and &#x27;str&#x27; Sorts the elements in the python list in ascending or descending orderBy default, the function sorted() or method sort() will sort the list in ascending order. So if you want to sort the elements in the python list in ascending order, then you write the function and method by default as Kiyoshi showed above. If you want to change the sort order to descending, write the function with the following syntax: new_list = sorted ( ordinary_list , reverse = True) The difference here is that we need to specify the value reverse from the default value False to True.Let’s see the following example: Copymylist = [&quot;C&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;]print(mylist)#&gt;&gt; [&quot;C&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;]# Sort in ascending ordernewlist = sorted(mylist)print(newlist)#&gt;&gt; [&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;]# Sort in descending ordernewlist = sorted(mylist, reverse=True)print(newlist)#&gt;&gt; [&quot;C&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot;] Let’s try another more complicated example: Copycolorlist = [&quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;]asc_colorlist = sorted(colorlist)desc_colorlist = sorted(colorlist, reverse=True)print(&quot;Ordinary list:&quot;, colorlist)#&gt;&gt; Ordinary list: [&#x27;Blue&#x27;, &#x27;Red&#x27;, &#x27;Green&#x27;, &#x27;White&#x27;, &#x27;Black&#x27;]print(&quot;ascending: &quot;, asc_colorlist)#&gt;&gt; ascending: [&#x27;Black&#x27;, &#x27;Blue&#x27;, &#x27;Green&#x27;, &#x27;Red&#x27;, &#x27;White&#x27;]print(&quot;descending :&quot;, desc_colorlist)#&gt;&gt; descending: [&#x27;White&#x27;, &#x27;Red&#x27;, &#x27;Green&#x27;, &#x27;Blue&#x27;, &#x27;Black&#x27;] Sorts the element in the python list using an intermediate function In the previous section, we learned how to sort the elements using directly the values ​​of the elements in the list. In addition to this way, we can also use the value of these elements as an argument to another function, then get the value to perform the element sort.This is especially useful when you want to decide how to sort your list not based on the value of the element, but on the length of the string that makes up the element, the absolute value of the element, etc. The syntax in this case is as follows: newlist = sorted ( ordinary_list, key = function) In it, we can use function names like abs, len etc.Let’s see the example below: Sorts the element in the python list according to the length of the string that makes up the element in the stringWe’ll specify the function name to use len: the function that finds the length of the string that makes up the element in the list.You can refer to len function to find the length of List python Copymylist = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;pen&quot;, &quot;desk&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;]sorted(mylist)#&gt;&gt; [&#x27;apple&#x27;, &#x27;banana&#x27;, &#x27;desk&#x27;, &#x27;pen&#x27;]sorted(mylist, key=len)#&gt;&gt; [&#x27;pen&#x27;, &#x27;desk&#x27;, &#x27;apple&#x27;, &#x27;banana&#x27;] Sorts the element in the python list according to the absolute value of the element in the stringWe need to specify the function name to use abs: the function to give the absolute value, like in the following example: Copymylist = [5, -4, -7, 6]sorted(mylist)#&gt;&gt; [-7, -4, 5, 6]sorted(mylist, key=abs)#&gt;&gt; [-4, 5, 6, -7] Sorts the element in the python list by the value converted to lowercase of the element in the stringWe need to specify the function name to use str.lower: the function converts a string to lowercase, like in the following example: Copyanimallist = [&quot;Cat&quot;, &quot;monkey&quot;, &quot;bear&quot;, &quot;Sheep&quot;, &quot;cow&quot;]sortlist = sorted(animallist)lowersortlist = sorted(animallist, key=str.lower)print(animallist)#&gt;&gt; [&#x27;Cat&#x27;, &#x27;monkey&#x27;, &#x27;bear&#x27;, &#x27;Sheep&#x27;, &#x27;cow&#x27;]print(sortlist)#&gt;&gt; [&#x27;Cat&#x27;, &#x27;Sheep&#x27;, &#x27;bear&#x27;, &#x27;cow&#x27;, &#x27;monkey&#x27;]print(lowersortlist)#&gt;&gt; [&#x27;bear&#x27;, &#x27;Cat&#x27;, &#x27;cow&#x27;, &#x27;monkey&#x27;, &#x27;Sheep&#x27;] Disadvantages of sorting using functions sortedor methodssortAlthough these two methods are very easy to use and can be correctly arranged in most cases, in some cases the function sorted() or method sort() may not be able to produce the most natural sort results, like in the example. down here: Copya = [&#x27;2 ft 7 in&#x27;, &#x27;1 ft 5 in&#x27;, &#x27;10 ft 2 in&#x27;, &#x27;2 ft 11 in&#x27;, &#x27;7 ft 6 in&#x27;]sorted(a)print(a)#&gt;&gt;[&#x27;2 ft 7 in&#x27;, &#x27;1 ft 5 in&#x27;, &#x27;10 ft 2 in&#x27;, &#x27;2 ft 11 in&#x27;, &#x27;7 ft 6 in&#x27;] The result we want is: Copy[&#x27;1 ft 5 in&#x27;, &#x27;2 ft 7 in&#x27;, &#x27;2 ft 11 in&#x27;, &#x27;7 ft 6 in&#x27;, &#x27;10 ft 2 in&#x27;] However, as in the above example, the function has sortednot given the desired result.

Let’s learn how to insert elements into a list python by insert method or python list slicing function in this lesson. We use the method insert(), or use slicing list to insert elements into List python. Insert element at the specified position in the python list using the insert methodvị trí xác định trong list python bằng phương thức insertSyntax of inserting elements into the specified position in the python list with the method insert() as follows: List.insert (index, value ) Inside: List is the original list index is the position to add an element to the original list giá trị is the value of the element to be added. Here, index and value is called parameter of the method insert().The element to be added will be added to the position in front of the index specified in the list.How to define the index in the python list, please review the index in python post .Specifically, we need to write the following: Copymylist = [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;]mylist.insert(1, &quot;Z&quot;)print(mylist)#--&gt; [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;] As you can see, the character Z has been added to the position before index 1 (the letter B), that is, between the letter A and B then right? Let’s look at a more complex example: Copymylist = [ &quot;Blue&quot; , &quot;Red&quot; , &quot;Green&quot; ]# Add value &#x27;White&#x27; before index 2 mylist.insert ( 2 , &quot;White&quot; ) print (mylist) # &gt;&gt; [&#x27;Blue&#x27;, &#x27;Red&#x27;, &#x27;White&#x27;, &#x27;Green&#x27;]# Add value &#x27;Black&#x27; to the top of list mylist.insert ( 0 , &quot;Black&quot; ) print (mylist) # &gt;&gt; [&#x27;Black&#x27;, &#x27;Blue&#x27;, &#x27;Red&#x27;, &#x27;White&#x27;, &#x27;Green&#x27;] Like above, you can easily insert elements at the specified position in the python list using the insert method . Insert elements into python list with slice functionIn the previous lesson, we learned how to change an element or slice a list from the original list using the slice function in Python . In fact, you can completely use this function to insert elements into List python.The idea here is to use slices to specify an empty range (no elements exist) and insert a new list into that blank.The syntax we need to use is as follows: ordinary list [index : index ] = add list Here, we write list[ index: index] to specify an empty range at the position indexin the original list. Then we will insert this blank with the list to add.And add list (located to the right of the sign =) will be added in front of ordinary list.Specifically, we need to write the following: Copymylist = [ &quot;A&quot; , &quot;B&quot; , &quot;C&quot; ] mylist [ 1 : 1 ] = [ &quot;D&quot; , &quot;E&quot; ]print (mylist) # ---&gt; [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;] We can manipulate numeric analogy in python like in the following example: Copymylist = [ &quot;1&quot; , &quot;2&quot; , &quot;3&quot; ] addlist = [ &quot;4&quot; , &quot;5&quot; ]# Insert another list before index 1 mylist [ 1 : 1 ] = addlist print (mylist)# --- [&#x27;1&#x27;, &#x27;4&#x27;, &#x27;5&#x27;, &#x27;2&#x27;, &#x27;3&#x27;] SummarizeAbove, Kiyoshi showed you how to insert element into python list by insert method or python list slicing function .

Want to combine yesterday’s inventory with today?Your requests can be handled by python in a flash, and we’ll learn how to add elements to list python, how to combine lists in python and how to repeat elements in list python with the following lesson. Add elements to list python using the append methodWe add an element to the python list using the method appendwith the following syntax: list.append( value) This new element will be added to the end of the list, like in the following example: Copymylist = [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;]mylist.append(&quot;D&quot;)print(mylist)#--&gt; [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;]mylist.append(&quot;K&quot;)print(mylist)#--&gt; [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;,&quot;K&quot;] Remember, to add an element to the end of the list you use the method append() in python. Add elements to list python with slice listIn the previous post we learned how to use the python list slicing function to change the value of multiple elements at the same time in python list .In this article, we will learn more about how to use this function to add elements to the python list, with the following syntax: list [ len (list) : len (list)] = list, string etc.. he idea here is, we will replace the last part of the list with a new one. The last part of the list is defined by list[len(list): len(list)], so when we replace this part, a new string of elements (to the right of the mark =) is added to the end of the original list.Let’s see the following example for better understanding: Copymylist = [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;]print(mylist[len(mylist):len(mylist)])#--&gt;[]# At the end of the list, there are no elements. result returns an empty list.mylist[len(mylist):len(mylist)] = [&quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;]print(mylist)#--&gt; [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;] You can see that the list specified to the right of the mark = was added to the end of the original list. Add elements of another list to the original list using the method extend()When we want to add elements of another list to the original list, we use the method extend() like : list.extend( add_list) The elements inside add_list (located to the right of the sign =) will be taken and added in to the original list. In addition to the list, you can also specify a tuple, or string, etc to add to the initial list.See the following example: Copymylist = [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;]mylist.extend([&quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;])print(mylist)#--&gt; [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;] Distinguish different methods extendand methods appendas below: method append adds the argument as a new element to the original list method extend adds the elements of the argument to the original list. For example: Copy#append method adds the new list as an element to the old listmylist = [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;]mylist.append([&quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;])print(mylist)#--&gt; [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, [&quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;]]#the extend method adds each element of the new list to the old listmylist = [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;]mylist.extend([&quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;])print(mylist)##--&gt; [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;] How to combine lists in pythonTo combine lists together in python, we use math + to concatenate them and create a new list like so: list A + list B + list C + … For example: Copylist1 = [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;]list2 = [&quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;]list3 = [&quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]list4 = list1 + list2 + list3print(list4)#--&gt;[&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, &#x27;D&#x27;, &#x27;E&#x27;, &#x27;F&#x27;] Repeat elements in list pythonWe use math * to iterate over the elements in the old list and create a new list like: list * số lần For example Copylist = [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;]newlist = list * 3print(newlist)#--&gt; [&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;] Summarize and practiceAbove, Kiyoshi showed you how to add elements to a list and how to combine lists together in python .

You will learn how to change element value in a list python using various methods after this lesson.","text":"Instructions on how to change value of element in list python. You will learn how to change element value in a list python using various methods after this lesson. After initializing a python List, you can change the value of an element in the list, in a variety of ways. Change the value of a specific element in list pythonWhen we want to change the value of a specific element in the python list, we need to specify that element’s index and then replace the new value in, with the following syntax: list [index] = value Try replacing the value of the second element in the list (whose index equals 1, since the index starts counting from 0) in the following example: Copylist_fruit = [ &quot;Apple&quot; , &quot;Orange&quot; , &quot;Strawberry&quot; ]print(list_fruit)#--&gt; [ &quot;Apple&quot; , &quot;Orange&quot; , &quot;Strawberry&quot; ]# thay đổi giá trị của phần tử thứ hai trong listlist_fruit[1] = &quot;Grape&quot;print(list_fruit)[&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Grape&quot;, &quot;Strawberry&quot;] As you can see, the element Orange with the index 1 specified with list_fruit[1] has been replaced with Grape after performing the value change command. List python, which is a form of data in which the elements are ordered and can change value after being declared.Therefore, after we change the value of an element in the list, essentially only the value of that element changes, and the properties of that list (like list name, data type, id of type data etc.) does not change.So the way we use that list won’t change either. For example with the above results list: Copylist_fruit = [ &quot;Apple&quot; , &quot;Orange&quot; , &quot;Strawberry&quot; ]print(&#x27;data type id =&#x27; + str(id(list_fruit)))#--&gt; data type id =139986404189376list_fruit[1] = &quot;Grape&quot;print(&#x27;data type id =&#x27; + str(id(list_fruit)))#--&gt; data type id =139986404189376 We have changed the value of an element in the list, and the property of the list (the data type id ) has not changed. Change the value of multiple elements at once by slicing the list We can change the value of multiple elements at the same time by using the slice function in Python , with the following syntax: list [start index : end index] = list, string etc By specifying a start and end index, we will determine the range of elements that need to be valued. Then, by specifying the values ​​that will replace the above range, we proceed to change the value by series. The method of specifying the index is the same as when we slice the list, the scope begins with the element’s index, and the scope ends with the end element’s index +1.The values ​​to replace the range above are a range of other elements, with the data type being list, or character, tuple and so on.Note, if you specify the alternate sequence as a string, for example ABC, the sequence will be treated as a character list with letter-by-letter elements in the sequence, such as [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;]. In the following example, we will replace a series of elements from second to fourth (i.e. starting index = 1, ending index = 4) in the following list: Copymylist = [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]print(mylist)#--&gt; [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]# Change a series of elements from second to fourth position in listmylist[1:4] = [&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;]print(mylist)#--&gt; [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;] Again, the number of elements in the substitution sequence is not necessarily the same as the number of elements in the range we are currently replacing.More is fine, but less is okay. For example below, we will take a range with fewer elements and replace the elements in the scope of the original list: Copymylist = [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]print(mylist)#--&gt; [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]# Replace a range of elements with a range with fewer elementsmylist[1:4] = [&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;]print(mylist)#--&gt; [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;] Also, in case you want to jump when changing the value of an element within the specified range, for example, remove the first element, then change the second element, and then ignore the third element … , use the jump method when slicing the list as the following example: Copymylist = [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]print(mylist)#--&gt; [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]# jumps an element and changes the value of other elements from the 2nd to the 6th in the listmylist[1:7:2] = [&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;]print(mylist)#--&gt; [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;3&quot;] SummarizeAbove, Kiyoshi showed you how tochange the value of an element in list python .

You will learn what is the concept of slice list python, what is the index of the elements in a list , as well as how to truncate list in python using indexes after this lesson. What is slice list pythonThe slice list in Python is the manipulation of getting a number of elements from a list . To slice list in python, we need to specify the starting and ending position of the cut, using the following syntax: list [start position : end position] Inside, List : initial list start position : the index of the element at the beginning of trimming end position : the index of the element at the end of truncation plus 1 unit. Note that the end position is equal to index of these element at end position + 1, because when using python’s slice function, the cut out only includes the element in the original cut position to before the element at the end position, not before. includes the element at the end position. So if we want to get the element at the end position, we need to specify an extra unit. For example we have a list of numbers nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and want to cut out the elements from 1 to 5, we will write the following: Copynums = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] newlist = nums [ 0 : 5 ]print (nums) print (newlist) Result: Copy[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] What is the index of the elements in the listIn the above section appears the concept of index, also known as the index of the elements in the list , so it can make many of you confused.The index of elements in the list is understood as the ordinal number or the position of an element in the list containing it. Each element will have only its own index and unique in the list.Hence we can slice the list or access elements in the list through this index.There are two ways of defining an index: Index is positive from left to right, starting with 0 and increasing by 1 Index is negative from right to left, starting with -1 and decreasing by 1 unit For example, we define the indexes of the list [&quot;Hà Nội&quot;, &quot;Sài Gòn&quot;, &quot;Đà Nẵng&quot;] as follows: Can remember simply the index in python if counting from the beginning then start counting from 0 and if counting from the end, it will start counting from -1 . In the next section we will learn how to slice list in python using indexes. Slice list in python by specifying the cut off rangeBy specifying the starting position and the index ending position of the elements at those positions, we can slice list in python like in the following example: Copynums = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] print (nums [ 2 : 5 ]) print (nums [- 5 : - 2 ]) Result: Copy[3, 4, 5] [6, 7, 8] Cut the list in python from the top of the list to the middle of the listTo slice list in python from the top of list to the middle of list, we omit its start position when writing list cut syntax.For example we write [:5]. Then, python implicitly implicitly starts with 0 position and cuts list similar to when writing [0: 5] as following example: Copynums = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] newlist1 = nums [ 0 : 5 ] newlist2 = nums [: 5 ]print (newlist1) print (newlist2) Result: Copy[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Slicelist in python from the middle of list to the end of listTo slice list in python from the middle of list to the end of list, we omit its end position when writing list cut syntax.For example we write [5:]. Then, python implicitly implicitly ends with the number of elements of the list (can be calculated by the len () function) as shown in the following example: Copynums = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] newlist3 = nums [ 5 :] newlist4 = nums [ 5 : 10 ] newlist5 = nums [ 5 : len (nums)]print (newlist3) print (newlist4) print (newlist5) Result: Copy[6, 7, 8, 9, 10] [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] Slice list in python by specifying stepWhen specifying a step when slicing list in python, we can cut out elements with index separated by the number of steps, like the following example: Copynums = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] print (nums [:: 1 ]) print (nums [:: 2 ]) print (nums [:: 3 ]) Result: Copy[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] [1, 4, 7, 10] We can also specify a step with a start and end position as follows: Copynums = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] print (nums [ 2 : 7 : 1 ]) print (nums [ 2 : 7 : 2 ]) print (nums [- 7 : - 2 : 3 ]) Result: Copy[3, 4, 5, 6, 7] [3, 5, 7] [4, 7] Cut back the list in pythonWhen specifying a starting and ending position with a negative index, we can invert a list in python like in the following example: Copyprint (nums [:: - 1 ]) print (nums [:: - 2 ]) Result: Copy[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] [10, 8, 6, 4, 2] We also have an inverted slice list in python with a start and end position as follows: Copynums = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] print (nums [ 8 : 2 : - 1 ]) print (nums [- 2 : - 9 : - 2 ]) Result: Copy[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4] [9, 7, 5, 3] Parse a list by trimming the list in pythonWith the application of cutting lists in python, we can split a list into many different parts. In the following example, we will split an original list into two smaller lists: Copyn = 4 nums = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ]nums1 = nums [: n] nums2 = nums [n:]print (nums1) print (nums2) Result: Copy[1, 2, 3, 4] [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] SummarizeAbove, Kiyoshi showed you how to slice list in python.

You will learn how to access elements in Python lists using indexes, positive and negative index in python, how to access last element in python listafter this lesson. We can access the element in the Python list through the index of that element in the list.Here’s how to do it: Access elements in Python list using indexWe access the elements in the Python list by index with the following syntax: list [index] Inside: list is the list for which we need to access Element index is the index of the element in the list that we need to access. For example Copyprovince = [ &quot;Thanh Hoa&quot; , &quot;Hanoi&quot; , &quot;Saigon&quot; , &quot;Da Nang&quot; ] province [1]&gt;&gt; Hanoi Positive and negative index in python Positive indexing in python/h3> Each element in the list is assigned an index - the ordinal number that specifies the position of that element in the list.The first element of the list has an index 0, then ascending 1, 2, 3…in reverse order.When specifying an element’s index, each element will have only its own index in the list, so that we can access and retrieve the value of that element in the list by specifying the index of the element. there.For example, the index element in the list is [“Thanh Hoa”, “Hanoi”, “Saigon”, “Da Nang”] as follows: [\"Thanh Hoa\", \"Hanoi\", \"Saigon\", \"Da Nang\"] ----------------------------------------- 0 1 2 4 Let’s look at an example, with this indexing, we will access, get the value of each element and print to the screen in the following order: Copyprovince = [ &quot;Thanh Hoa&quot; , &quot;Hanoi&quot; , &quot;Saigon&quot; , &quot;Da Nang&quot; ] print (province [ 1 ]) # &gt;&gt; Hanoiprint (province [ 2 ]) # &gt;&gt; Saigonprint (province [ 3 ]) # &gt;&gt; Danang Negative index in python listIn addition to specifying an index with positive numbers, we can do the opposite by specifying an index with negative numbers.The last element (right-hand side) of the list has an index of -1, then descends -1, -2,-3…towards the top (left-hand side). For example, the index element in the list is [“Thanh Hoa”, “Hanoi”, “Saigon”, “Da Nang”] as follows: [\"Thanh Hoa\", \"Hanoi\", \"Saigon\", \"Da Nang\"] --------------------------------------------- -4 -3 -2 -1 Let’s rewrite the above example by specifying the index as a negative number as follows: Copyprovince=[ &quot;Thanh Hoa&quot; , &quot;Hanoi&quot; , &quot;Saigon&quot; , &quot;Da Nang&quot; ] print (province [- 1 ]) # &gt;&gt; Danangprint (province [- 2 ]) # &gt;&gt; Sài Gònprint (province [- 3 ]) # &gt;&gt; Hanoi IndexErrorNote that when accessing elements in Python list via index, if you specify an index that does not exist in the list, the IndexError will occur . Copyprovince = [ &quot;Hanoi&quot; , &quot;Saigon&quot; , &quot;Da Nang&quot; ] print (province [ 3 ])#&gt;&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):#&gt;&gt; File &quot;&quot;, line 2, in &lt;module&gt;#&gt;&gt; print(province[3])#&gt;&gt;IndexError: list index out of range This error occurs, like you are trying to get money from your wallet althought there was no money left in your wallet. Access last element in python listWe can access last element in python list by specifying that element’s index through the len() function . Len() in python is a function used to find the length or number of elements of an object in python. If this object is list, the function will output the number of elements in the specified Python list You can find out details about the len () function in the article Len() trong Python. We will count the number of elements in Python list in the above example as follows: Copyprovince = [ &quot;Hanoi&quot; , &quot;Saigon&quot; , &quot;Da Nang&quot; ] length = len (province) print (length)#&gt;&gt; 3 Since the index of the first element in the list is equal 0, its index phần tử cuối cùngwill be equal số phần tử -1.So when we access the last element in the python list , we write with the following syntax: list ( len(list) -1) Let’s try to access the last element of the list in the above example as follows: Copyprovince = [ &quot;Hanoi&quot; , &quot;Saigon&quot; , &quot;Da Nang&quot; ] last_inter = province [ len (province) - 1 ] print (last_inter)# &gt;&gt; Da Nang Summarize and practiceAbove, Kiyoshi showed you how to access elements in Python list .

You will learn how to create list in python by specifying a value , create list in python using variable , create list in python using multiplication operator, create list in python using list () function, create list in python using range after this lesson. Create list in python by specifying a valueTo create a list in python, we specify the value of the elements inside the ampersand pair [] and separated by signs , with the following syntax: [Element 1, Element 2, …] Elements can be any form of data Python can handle, such as numbers and strings.For example: Copy[10, 20, 30, 40, 50][&#x27;Hanoi&#x27; , &#x27;Saigon&#x27;, &#x27;Cantho&#x27;] You can also use different data types for each element in the same list. Copy[&#x27;Kiyoshi&#x27;, 30 , True] Alternatively, you can also use a list as an element in another list. Copy[&#x27;Cam&#x27; , &#x27;Táo&#x27; , [&#x27;Dâu xanh&#x27; , &#x27;Dâu đỏ&#x27;]] You can also create an empty list in python with the following writing: Copy[] You can also assign a list to a variable for later use. Copybasket = [ &#x27;Orange&#x27; , &#x27;Apple&#x27; , [ &#x27;Green Strawberry&#x27; , &#x27;Red Strawberry&#x27; ]] for fruit in fruit basket: print (fruit) Result Oranges Apple ['Green Strawberry', 'Red Strawberry'] Create list in python using variablesUsing this approach, instead of directly specifying the value of an element in the list, we will assign that value to a variable and use the variable’s value to initialize the list.For example: Copyx = 10y = 15numlist = [x, y]print (numlist) Result: [10, 15] It should be noted here that we only use the value of the variable to initialize the element value when creating the list, rather than creating a reference relationship between the variable and the elements in the list. Therefore, after creating the list, if we change the value of the variable, then the value of the element in the list will not be changed.For example: Copyx = 10y = 15numlist = [x, y] print (numlist)# Replace the value of x, yx = 20y = 25 print (numlist) Kết quả: [10, 15] [10, 15] Create list python using multiplication operatorWhen in a list containing the same elements, we can iterate over a list and create a new list using the multiply operator with the following syntax: List = [element] * number Example with numbers: Copy# khởi tạo một list gồm 10 số 0numlist = [0] * 10print(numlist) Result: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] String example: Copy# khởi tạo một list gồm 6 chuỗi &#x27;null&#x27;numlist = [&#x27;null&#x27;] * 6print(numlist) Result: ['null', 'null', 'null', 'null', 'null', 'null'] This is very convenient when you want to create a list with some specific elements that need to be initialized. Alternatively, you can use this iteration to iterate over a list in another list, as shown in the following example: Copynumlist = [10, 20, 30] * 3print (numlist) Result: [10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 30] Create list in python using the list () functionThe list () function is commonly used to create list in python with the following syntax: newlist= list( iterable) In which iterable are objects with many elements such as string, tuple, dictionary and so on. For example: Copynums = list (( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 )) # creates list from tuple using the function list () print (nums) # &gt;&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]strs = list ( &#x27;abcde&#x27; ) # creates list from string using list () print (strs) # &gt;&gt; [&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;, &#x27;d&#x27;, &#x27;e&#x27;] Detailed instructions on this can be found at the article Create list by using iterable in python . Create list in python using rangeBy combining the list () function and the range () function, you can create a list whose elements are a sequence of consecutive numbers, with the following syntax: newlist= list( range(start, end, step)) For example: Copynums1 = list ( range ( 5 )) print (nums1)nums2 = list ( range (- 5 , 6 )) print (nums2)nums3 = list ( range ( 1 , 11 , 2 )) print (nums3) Result: Copy[0, 1, 2, 3, 4] [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] Detailed instructions on this can be found at the article Create list by using iterable in python.

You will learn about slice a string python by index, jumping when slicing strings as well as reduce arguments when slicing string in python after this lesson. Slice a string in python by indexTo slice a string in python by index, we will specify the starting position to cut the string and the end position from the original string to get the substring, according to the following syntax: str [ start position : end position ] Inside str is the original string from which we want to slice start position is the index of the character from which we will begin cutting the string. end position is the index of the character we will end up trimming at that position plus 1 unit 🌟 Note that the cut out string does not include any characters at end position, so when specifying, we need to add 1 unit to end position. Thus, the cut string will include the characters in end position. 🌟 About the index numbering of the character in the string, start the index numbering of the leftmost character with 0, then add 1 and move forward to the right. Note that the index numbering starts from 0, not from 1.You can see more about specifying an index in python string at the pos Get character in python string. Slice the string in python exampleSuppose we need to cut the string city and create a new string from the original string bigcityboy. The index numbering of the characters in the original string.The index value of the characters in the string is bigcityboy as follows: b i g c i t y b o y ------------------- 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Determination start position.In the above example, we start cutting at the position of the character c(the starting character of the string city) whose index is 3.Hence start position by this index value. Determination end position.In the above example, we will cut to the position of the character y whose index is 6.In order for the newly created string to contain this character, we need to add 1 unit so the value of end position will be 7. Write a cut order.In this example would be bigcityboy[3:7] We write the sample code as follows: Copystr = &quot;bigcityboy&quot;print (str[3:7]) Result city Similarly, we can cut other strings and create new string from the original string as follows: Copystr = &quot;bigcityboy&quot;print (str[3:6])#&gt;&gt; citstr = &quot;bigcityboy&quot;print (str[2:4])#&gt;&gt; gc Reduce arguments when slicing string in pythonIn some cases we can omit the argument start position or end position as itshown below. Reduce start position when slicing string in pythonWe can omit start position when cutting string in python in case of start position equal 0, which means we will cut from the beginning of the original string.For example:Ví dụ: Copystr = &quot;bigcityboy&quot;print (str[:7]) We can also specify the start position as following: Copystr = &quot;bigcityboy&quot;print (str[0:7]) Both spellings produce the same result: Copybigcity Reduce end position when slicing string in pythonWe can omit end position when cutting the string in python in case end position equal to the length of the original string, which means we will cut until the end of the original string.For example: Copystr = &quot;bigcityboy&quot;print (str[3:]) Chúng ta cũng có thể chỉ định vị trí kết thúc như sau: Copystr = &quot;bigcityboy&quot;print (str[3:10]) Both spellings produce the same result: Copycityboy About how to calculate the length of the string, you can refer to the article on calculating the length of the string in python. Reduce both start position and end position when slicing string in pythonWhen we dropped both start position and end position when slicing string in python, a new string will create exactly the original string. For example: Copystr = &quot;bigcityboy&quot;print (str[:]) We can also specify start position and end position as follows: Copystr = &quot;bigcityboy&quot;print (str[0:10]) Both spellings produce the same result: Copybigcityboy Jumping when slicing strings in pythonWhen cutting string in python, by default we will get all characters from start position to end position when cutting.However, we can also jump when cutting strings in python.For example we can take one character and skip the next 2 characters, then get the character again and remove the next 2 characters and so on.Once there, we need to specify an additional parameter step when cutting the string in python, with the following syntax: string [ start position : end position : step] For example, together with the string bigcityboy above , we can jump 2 steps when cutting the string like this: Copystr = &quot;bigcityboy&quot;print (str[3:7:2])print (str[3:10:3]) Result ict cyy SummaryWe can cut the string in python by specifying the start and end position of the cut in the original string.Also when cutting the string, we can jump by specifying an extra number of hops when writing the string trimming command in python.","categories":[{"name":"PYTHON","slug":"PYTHON","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/categories/PYTHON/"},{"name":"Nhập môn lập trình python","slug":"PYTHON/Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/categories/PYTHON/Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/"},{"name":"Thao tác với chuỗi string trong python","slug":"PYTHON/Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/Thao-tac-voi-chuoi-string-trong-python","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/categories/PYTHON/Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/Thao-tac-voi-chuoi-string-trong-python/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Nhập môn lập trình python","slug":"Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/tags/Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/"},{"name":"Thao tác với chuỗi string trong python","slug":"Thao-tac-voi-chuoi-string-trong-python","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/tags/Thao-tac-voi-chuoi-string-trong-python/"}]},{"title":"Four ways to run python code directly","slug":"python/nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/kien-thuc-can-ban-ve-chuong-trinh-python/lam-chu-bon-cach-chay-python-pho-bien","date":"2020-08-20T07:53:22.000Z","updated":"2021-04-20T10:52:20.859Z","comments":true,"path":"python/nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/kien-thuc-can-ban-ve-chuong-trinh-python/lam-chu-bon-cach-chay-python-pho-bien/","link":"","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/python/nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/kien-thuc-can-ban-ve-chuong-trinh-python/lam-chu-bon-cach-chay-python-pho-bien/","excerpt":"In this article, we will learn four ways to run python code directly on four programs that create the popular python programming environment.","text":"In this article, we will learn four ways to run python code directly on four programs that create the popular python programming environment. Select a program to create a python programming environmentTo run python, you need a software that creates a python programming environment so that we can enter the python code and run it. There are many python programming environments to choose from, you can choose from one of them below. Command PromptCommand Prompt is a built-in Windows program that helps you run python code directly on the DOS platform. You can refer to how to start Command Prompt at How to start Command Prompt on a computer. In addition to using the Command Prompt to run python code, you can also use this program to run a program that has been saved in the python file. You can refer to the article How to write python programs, save and run python programs. However, in order to be able to run python on the Command Prompt, there is a requirement that you have installed python on your computer, and installed the python environment on the windows operating system. You can also replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell. Both of these programs provide a DOS platform that helps to run python code directly. Anaconda Prompt Anaconda Prompt is a program that helps enter commands and run python code directly. This is the software that is integrated when you install python with Anaconda. If you have installed python with Anaconda, you can start this program by going to the Anaconda Prompt icon in the Programs tab on the Start Menu, or you can press Windows key then enter Anaconda Prompt to find the program. Then click on the icon and launch it. Like the Command Prompt, the Anaconda Prompt program can also be used to save a program to a python file. You can refer to the article How to write python programs, save and run python programs. Jupyter-NoteBookIf you are used to manipulating directly on browsers such as Google Chrome or Coccoc, Firefox, you can use Jupyter NoteBook - a software that helps to run python code directly in the browser which is integrated when installing Anaconda.Jupyter with the ability to save both commands and execution results such as logs or graphs, will help you save time when re-opening the program you are writing. You can start Jupyter similar to Anaconda Prompt by looking for the program’s icon in the Programs tab on the Start Menu. paiza.iopaiza.io is a website that provides an online platform to run programs written in many languages, including python. If you have not already installed python on your computer, then running online on this website is not a bad choice at all. In the tutorials on laptrinhcanban.com , Kiyoshi also casually uses paiza.io as an online practice window to help you review knowledge in each article. Run the python codeAfter starting one of the above software, we have the python programming environment ready. Now you can run the python code directly by entering the lines of python code on the screen of the above software, click Enterand execute them. For example you can use the following command line to check the version of python: Copypython --version Let’s see the python command input screen and the returned results with the Anaconda Prompt software as shown below: SummaryAbove, Kiyoshi showed you four ways to run python code directly.

You will know how to choose software to write python code , how to write a python program , how to save a python file as well as how to run a python program in this article. Software to write python codeWe can write python code with most popular coding software today such as Notepad ++ , Sublime Text , or Visual Studio - Microsoft . If you don’t have these software installed on your computer, you can even use the simplest python coding software , which called Notepad - text editing software available in windows. Kiyoshi often uses Notepadd ++ software to write python code, so within this website I will guide you to write python code with Notepad ++ software.You can download this software at https://notepad-plus-plus.org .Alternatively, you can also use the following coding programs: Sublime Text: free python code writing software, download at https://www.sublimetext.com/3Visual Studio - Microsoft: free python coding software for free, download at Microsoft visualstudio Pycharm: paid python coding software, download at https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/ For those in Japan, you can use Sakura editor’s free python coding software , download at https://sakura-editor.github.io/download.html How to write python programIn python, you will write python program by editing on python code and save this python file with .py file extension . You can then run the python program that is saved in this python file, or edit it as many times as you like.Here let’s see the python program writing process with python Notepad ++ coding software . Start software to write python code and write python program.First of all, start the python Notepad ++ code writing software, then you will write the program’s command lines directly into the image of this software. As an example, we will enter the lines of code of a simple python program below into the screen of Notepad ++ Copyprint ( &quot;What&#x27;s your name?&quot; ) yourname = input ( &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; ) print ( &quot;Hello&quot; , yourname) Code explanation: Line 1: Use the print function to print a single line of text What is your name? screen Line 2: Use the input function to assign the value entered from the keyboard to the variable yourname Line 3: Use the print function to print the program result to the screen.The Notepad ++ screen will look like this: Set the programming language to be used in the programWhen you write the above lines of code in Notepad ++ , Notepad ++ still does not know where the programming language you are using is python, so the auto color correction function makes it easier to compose Notepad ++. has not been activated. Therefore, you must set the programming language to use in the program to be python in one of the two ways below: Method 1: Click Language&gt; P&gt; Python Method 2: Press Alt + L&gt; P&gt; Python At that time, Notepad ++ will automatically change the text color to help you distinguish the commands more easily as shown below: Save the python file with the .py file extensionAfter writing the command lines of the python program into the editing screen of the python coding software , we will save the python file with the .py file extension to run the python program written in this file, or save hold the program for later editing.The saved file will have a file name like this: filename.py For example, we will save the python file just written above with the name xinchao.py. The way to save the python file in Notepad ++ is as follows:-Click on File&gt; Save, then type xinchao.py in the Filename box.-Choose the file format as Python file (.py: .pyw) in the Save as type box.-Choose where to save the file by selecting the path in the Save in box. In this example, let’s say you save the file to folder D: \\ sample_code \\ xinchao.py.-Finally click Save to finish saving the file. How to run python program is written in python fileAfter saving the python file, we will have various ways to run the python program written in this file. One of the most common is to run the python program written in the file on the Anaconda Prompt or on the Command Prompt. However, no matter what platform you run the python program written in the python file, the syntax to run the python program will be as follows: python filename We write python, then the space , and then the python file name as above. Take for example the Anaconda Prompt. Start the Anaconda Prompt, then enter the lines of code in turn, press ENTER to run them as below: Copyd/d D:\\sample_codepython xinchao.py Explanation Code:-Line cd/d D:\\sample_codeis to move to the folder containing the file python xinchao.py. -Theline python xinchao.pyis to run the python xinchao.py file. Then the python file is processed, and the result of the python program written in it appears as below screen: In short to run a python file, you need to do two things: Move to the folder containing the python file with syntax cd / d-folder-path Run that python file with syntax python filename.py SummaryAbove, Kiyoshi showed you how to write python program, save and run python program.

However, depending on the learning goals we should or should not choose to learn this language. Who should learn PythonIf you are interested in software development to run oncomputerWith Python, you can easily create applications that run on your computer, from as simple as finding a file on your hard drive, to complex software like editing photos, creating mp4 videos from snapshots.Python supports fast processing from data files such as excel, json to popular audio and video files, so if you want to create software to improve and improve productivity, Python is a wise choice. If you are interested in artificial intelligence development - Deep LearningDeep Learning, is a technique in which computers automatically create structures through self-analyzing large amounts of data over and over to find the underlying patterns and then self-learning it. Through that, the computer will create AI capable of simulating the “” functions similar to the learning ability “that people naturally perform.There are many languages ​​that can be used in Deep Learning techniques, but with its huge data processing advantage, Python is currently at the top of the languages ​​used in this field. If you are interested in AI, then learn Python, because Python has many integrated libraries used for research and development of deep learning. In addition, with a simple grammar structure, you can call and use these libraries very simply, so it is easy to master and saves learning time. If you are interested in data analysisToday, almost every business uses databases, and with an increasingly large amount of stored information, has formed Big Data - huge data warehouses, for example Google or Facebook.Of course, regardless of the opportunity to work with Big Data in large enterprises, if you are working in a small business, you will definitely have to work with databases, for example, customer information. goods or products for example. And if you are having trouble analyzing these data, then Python is your choice.Python, with its typical library Pandas, helps you perform commands such as reading CSV file information, then add, edit, delete and analyze them easily and efficiently. Pandas (source: https://pythonawesome.com/) Who should not learn PythonIf you want to create a smartphone app (iPhone, Android)Of course you can use Python to create mobile apps, but if the numbers match Swift’s iPhone or Android’s Java, and more recently, Kotlin, Python has no advantage in the field. this.Furthermore, the information on how to create applications with Python is very limited, so if you really want to use Python in this case it will be very difficult and time consuming. If you want to develop web apps and servicesPython is a very popular language, so the developers created the following three web frameworks written in python as well. Django Flask BottleKiyoshi has not worked in Vietnam yet so he is not sure about the situation of using these frameworks, but in Japan, almost all web creation projects are written by Ruby and PHP. Therefore, python has the potential but has not been used as much as a main language to create web pages, but is mainly used to manage website data. If you want to develop Embedded System / ApplicationPython is a language that can run on most popular operating systems today. And since it is not OS dependent, Python can be used for developing large systems, or for creating embedded applications for use in other systems. However, because it is an interpreter - the translation of python into a language understood by the computer, and the execution of the task in parallel, the speed of python in the system will not be comparable. with other common languages ​​being used such as C / C ++. SummaryIn this article we have explored whether to learn python already. Although in some areas, Python has not fully developed its capabilities, but Kiyoshi believes that with the love that programmers have for it, Python will be increasingly improved and overcome.And as a language with a simple structure, easy to learn, Python will always be one of the top choices for those looking to start learning about programming.","categories":[{"name":"PYTHON","slug":"PYTHON","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/categories/PYTHON/"},{"name":"Nhập môn lập trình python","slug":"PYTHON/Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/categories/PYTHON/Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/"},{"name":"Giới thiệu python","slug":"PYTHON/Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/Gioi-thieu-python","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/categories/PYTHON/Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/Gioi-thieu-python/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Nhập môn lập trình python","slug":"Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/tags/Nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/"},{"name":"Giới thiệu python","slug":"Gioi-thieu-python","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/tags/Gioi-thieu-python/"}]},{"title":"What is Python","slug":"python/nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/gioi-thieu-python/python-la-gi","date":"2020-08-20T07:03:50.000Z","updated":"2021-04-20T09:34:58.570Z","comments":true,"path":"python/nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/gioi-thieu-python/python-la-gi/","link":"","permalink":"https://laptrinhcanban.com/python/nhap-mon-lap-trinh-python/gioi-thieu-python/python-la-gi/","excerpt":"Python is a great programming language, with a simple grammar that is easy to understand, but can do a lot of tasks with just a very short line of code.Because it’s simple, easy to understand, and very useful, Python is used in many important areas of life, such as AI development , or Website design , or education, healthcare. etc.","text":"Python is a great programming language, with a simple grammar that is easy to understand, but can do a lot of tasks with just a very short line of code.Because it’s simple, easy to understand, and very useful, Python is used in many important areas of life, such as AI development , or Website design , or education, healthcare. etc. For those of you who want to start learning to code, this is the language that should be ranked at the top of your study category, because it is both easy to learn, easy to understand , and can be applied in work and life. as well as many opportunities for future growth.For those of you who have experience with other languages, the more you need to learn about Python.
